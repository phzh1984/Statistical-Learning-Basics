# Statistical-Learning-Basics

Data: Information or facts collected for analysis, often numerical or categorical.

Level of Measurements: The classification of data into categories based on the nature of information they provide—nominal (categories with no order), ordinal (ordered categories), interval (equal intervals between values), and ratio (absolute zero and equal intervals).

Population and Sample: A population includes all individuals or items of interest, while a sample is a subset of the population used to make inferences or observations.

Central Tendency: A measure that represents the center or typical value of a dataset—mean, median, or mode.

Mean: The arithmetic average calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of values.

Median: The middle value in a dataset when arranged in ascending or descending order.

Mode: The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.

Dispersion: The spread or variability in a dataset, measures include range, variance, and standard deviation.

Range: The difference between the maximum and minimum values in a dataset.

Variance: A measure of how values in a dataset deviate from the mean.

Standard Deviation: A measure of the average deviation of values from the mean.

Quartiles: Values that divide a dataset into four equal parts.

Bivariate Data and Covariance: Data involving two variables and covariance measures how those variables change together.

Pearson Correlation Coefficient: Measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two continuous variables.

Spearman Rank Coefficient: Measures the strength and direction of monotonic relationships between variables.

Effect Size: Quantifies the magnitude of the relationship between variables in a statistical population or sample.

Probability: The likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as a number between 0 and 1.

Permutation: Arrangement of items in a particular order.

Combination: Selection of items disregarding the order.

Intersection, Unions, and Complements: Operations in set theory—intersection (common elements), union (all elements), and complement (non-occurrence).

Statistics: The study of collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data.

Sampling: The process of selecting a subset of individuals from a population for analysis.

Central Limit Theorem: States that the sample means of a dataset tend to be normally distributed when the sample size is large.

Standard Error: Estimates the variability between sample means and population means.

Hypothesis Testing: Statistical method to make inferences about populations based on sample data.

T-Distribution: Probability distribution used for hypothesis testing when the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown.

A/B Testing: Method to compare two versions of something to determine which performs better.

ANOVA: Analyzes the difference between means of three or more groups.

F-Distribution: Probability distribution that arises in the analysis of variance.

Chi-Square Analysis: Test of independence between categorical variables using frequency data.
